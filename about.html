                        <p>Here's a little bit of who I am.</p>
                    </header>

                    <h2>Why I Build Things</h2>
                    <p>I love watching ideas come to life. That's really it. Mechatronics pulled me in because it sits at the intersection of everything I find interesting &mdash; electronics (I got hooked the first time I watched someone solder), mechanical design, and code. I've always wanted to build things, and robotics just made sense as the place where all of that comes together.</p>
                    <p>I mostly hate school, but I love the subjects that actually matter to me. The ones where I leave class and immediately want to go apply something, or simply subjects that are indespensable for daily life &mdash; that includes math, of course. That gap &mdash; between what's required and what fires me up &mdash; is probably why I end up doing a lot on my own. I built a program to calculate black hole evaporation rates and energy output because the physics genuinely fascinated me, not for some grade. I built an app that fetched and downloaded Spotify songs before I even knew tools like that already existed. That's kind of how my brain works.</p>

                    <h2>Where I'm Actually From</h2>
                    <p>I grew up in Mexico and moved to Northville a little over a year ago. I don't really try to talk about it, I don't hide it either, but I'd rather be defined by the change I make to my surroundings, not by the change the surroundings have in me.</p>
                    <p>The KIA STEM program at Liceo de Apodaca is probably the thing I'm most proud of because of what it meant to me and the people I did it with &mdash; my closest friends, the best teacher I had.</p>

                    <hr />

                    <h2>The Long Game</h2>
                    <p>My actual goal in life has nothing to do with a corner office. I want to work hard enough, for long enough, to eventually buy a piece of land &mdash; grow things, plant trees, build a forest that outlives me and gets passed down to whoever comes after. Engineering is the path that gets me there. With some luck, it'll be a path I actually enjoy walking.</p>

                    <h2>The Rest of It</h2>
                    <p>When I'm not doing anything productive, I'm gaming, watching YouTube, listening to music, or zoning out completely. I hate noise without purpose but I'll crank music as loud as it goes. I'm told I'm funny. I think that's probably the most accurate thing people say about me.</p>
